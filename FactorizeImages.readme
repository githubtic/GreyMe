## Interactive Mapping & Analysis of Geographic Entities using Correspondence Analysis

### üéØ What is IMAGE AFC?

IMAGE AFC is an open-source project that combines **Correspondence Analysis** (Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances in French) with interactive geographic visualization. It helps researchers, analysts, and decision-makers discover hidden patterns in geographic data by:

- Analyzing relationships between locations and their characteristics
- Reducing complex multi-dimensional data into interpretable 2D visualizations
- Mapping statistical results onto interactive geographic maps
- Revealing spatial patterns that might not be obvious in traditional data tables

### üî¨ Understanding Correspondence Analysis (AFC)

**What is it?**
Correspondence Analysis is a statistical technique similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) but designed specifically for categorical or contingency table data. It helps identify the main patterns of association between rows and columns in a data matrix.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Inertia**: Total variance in the data that can be explained
- **Factors/Dimensions**: Principal axes that capture the most important patterns
- **Contributions**: How much each variable contributes to each factor
- **Quality of Representation**: How well each point is represented in the reduced space

### üó∫Ô∏è How IMAGE AFC Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Geographic entities (cities, regions, countries) are characterized by multiple variables
2. **AFC Analysis**: The correspondence analysis algorithm identifies the main patterns in the data
3. **Dimension Reduction**: Complex relationships are simplified into 2-3 main factors
4. **Geographic Mapping**: Statistical coordinates are mapped back to actual geographic locations
5. **Interactive Visualization**: Users can explore patterns through an interactive web interface

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of statistics
- Familiarity with web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Data in CSV or similar format with geographic coordinates

#### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the IMAGE AFC project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. **Click** "Generate Sample Dataset" to load example data
4. **Run** "AFC Analysis" to process the data
5. **Visualize** results on the interactive map

#### Sample Data Structure
Your input data should have this structure:
```csv
name,latitude,longitude,variable1,variable2,variable3,...
Paris,48.8566,2.3522,89,67,95
Lyon,45.7640,4.8357,72,78,84
```

### üìä Interpreting Results

#### Factor Interpretation
- **Factor 1**: Usually represents the strongest pattern of variation
- **Factor 2**: Captures the second most important pattern
- **Factor Loadings**: Show which variables contribute most to each factor

#### Map Visualization
- **Circle Size**: Represents the magnitude of factor scores
- **Circle Color**: Indicates the direction and combination of factor loadings
- **Position**: Geographic location of each entity
- **Popup Information**: Detailed factor scores and quality metrics

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

#### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- **Mathematics**: Math.js for statistical calculations
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with glassmorphism effects

#### Key Algorithms
1. **Data Standardization**: Normalize variables to comparable scales
2. **Contingency Matrix**: Transform data into correspondence analysis format
3. **SVD Decomposition**: Extract principal factors using singular value decomposition
4. **Coordinate Calculation**: Transform factor scores back to interpretable coordinates
